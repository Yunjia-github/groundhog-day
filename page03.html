	Phil gets dressed and goes out. He sees the hostess of the hotel was playing the piano in the lobby." It's already 7:50. I'm a bit running late." Phil says to himself. He decided to:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="page05.html">Listen to the piano performance for a while.</a></li>
		<li><a href="page04.html">Ignore and go away.</a></li>
	</ul>
