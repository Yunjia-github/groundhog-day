	A weather man is reluctantly sent to cover a story about a weather forecasting "rat" (as he calls it). This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. <br><br>On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that <b>it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. </b><br><br>First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realisation that he is doomed to spend <b>the rest of eternity in the same place</b>, seeing the same people do the same thing EVERY day.

	<b>Help him find his way out of "TODAY"!</b>
